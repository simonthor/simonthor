Hi!

I'm a PhD student at the ETH ZÃ¼rich, based at CERN. I mainly work with searching for neutrinos (one of the least understood fundamental particles) at the FASER experiment.
I also help out with Hyper-Kamiokande, a neutrino detector that is being constructed in Japan.

Outside of particle physics, I have also done research on aurora.

I mainly program in Python and C++, but I'm also interested in Julia. You can also find some projects written in MATLAB and Javascript here on Github.

For a highlight of my work, see the pinned projects below.
